            <div class="post-content">
                <p>This weekend I participated for the very first time in the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare game jam</a>, with my also first interactive fiction piece, and I have to say, I loved both experiences. OK, not so much the deadline pressure, but I had made a good schedule planning, and could follow it most of the time.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4EpblDY4msVtKAOk/giphy.gif" alt="I did it!"></p>
<p>Until a few days ago, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about interactive fiction. My husband told me I would like it when I said I was looking for enrolling in Ludum Dare this time, maybe with something low code, to do some educational game or something. He didn&rsquo;t have any experience with the tools themselves, but listed to me <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>, <a href="https://www.renpy.org/">Ren&rsquo;Py</a>, <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform</a> and a few others that people use to create visual novels and/or interactive fiction.</p>
<p>After playing with Twine and Ren&rsquo;Py for a few minutes to an hour, I decided to go for Twine this time. I used <a href="twinery.org/">Twine</a> and <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/">Sugarcube 2</a>, with some CSS tweaks &ndash; but it&rsquo;s mostly Sugarcube macros only. This library is so powerful &ndash; and fun to create with!</p>
<p>Most of the time, I feel most of the tools I use or learn currently get a lot in the way of accomplishing things. And Twine+Sugarcube felt something else completely: I wanted to create a story, create loops, create endings, and they made it very simple to do it. When audio effects came in, then not so much, but even so &ndash; things made sense, were consistent. There was no noise in the documentation, examples, etc.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/">jam theme came out on Friday evening</a>, I had this maybe a little obvious idea, and there was nothing educational about it. But I had a blast. I didn&rsquo;t even expect to like it that much. I loved both creating the story and its branches/possibilities/endings (interactively, as I progressed in my short day-sprints) as having a theme to think over and create it in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cstHEo3umAADEfFAvZ/giphy.gif" alt="I love it!"></p>
<p>At the end of the first complete day I had a (boring) playable version; at the end of Sunday I had a better one (with graphics and some audio); and finally some hours from the deadline on Monday I had a version I was happy to share &ndash; and a lot of other ideas documented (more like &ldquo;Future works&rdquo; than TODOs, actually), of course.</p>
<h2 id="play-it">Play it!</h2>
<p>There is no chance you&rsquo;ll enjoy playing my piece as much as I enjoyed doing it, but here it is anyway: you can <a href="https://mirianbr.itch.io/asylum">play it online on itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>And this is <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/asylum">my game page in LD game jam</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirianbr/asylum/main/screenshots/ld-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Asylum, my interactive fiction piece for Ludum Dare 49."></p>
<p>Drop me a note if you liked my story (or if you didn&rsquo;t, but played it anyway). I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think!</p>
<h2 id="download-and-play-with-it">Download and play with it!</h2>
<p>The HTML (and associated media) is on <a href="https://github.com/mirianbr/asylum">github</a>, and you can just download it and open in Twine. (Twine is so great, did I say this already?)</p>
