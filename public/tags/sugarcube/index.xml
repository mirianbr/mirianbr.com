      <description>This weekend I participated for the very first time in the Ludum Dare game jam, with my also first interactive fiction piece, and I have to say, I loved both experiences. OK, not so much the deadline pressure, but I had made a good schedule planning, and could follow it most of the time.
Until a few days ago, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about interactive fiction. My husband told me I would like it when I said I was looking for enrolling in Ludum Dare this time, maybe with something low code, to do some educational game or something.</description>
