Hello, I'm M√≠rian! üëãüèº

I'm an experienced IT professional, with a mixed industry, government and academy background, passionate about crafting solutions to help people and businesses thrive.  I provide training and consulting services on technical documentation, customer service and business processes to support these areas.

My interests range from language and culture to education, law, politics and technology.  I hold a [Master degree in Computer Science from PUCRS](https://www.pucrs.br/politecnica/programa-de-pos-graduacao-em-ciencia-da-computacao/), and three Bachelor degrees: [Law](https://www.unisinos.br/graduacao/direito/sao-leopoldo) (2020), [Information Systems](https://www.unisinos.br/graduacao/sistemas-de-informacao/sao-leopoldo) and [Computer Science](https://www.unisinos.br/graduacao/ciencia-da-computacao/sao-leopoldo), all from Unisinos.  For my full list of publications, check out my [Lattes academic profile](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0699925170261519).

When I'm not at work or thinking about my next projects, my favorite activities are reading, writing (check out [Asylum](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/asylum), my interactive fiction piece submitted to Ludum Dare Game Jam!), learning languages, watching fantasy TV series or movies, trying out new flavours, yoga practicing and traveling.
